# Java Server Programming

This repository contains primarily my school-related Java development work for creating a basic Java server application(s) with database connections and other extended features, depending on course requirements.

As of 1st September 2020, the code is not production-ready. It will evolve in time.

Code presented here is not currently in use on my website [fjordtek.com](https://fjordtek.com).
